# DynamicDNS
Finds dynamic DNS (like no-ip.org) domains from a given list of domains

## Usage
    python dyndns.py -f MyDomainList.txt -o dyndns_output.csv
    
## Notes
The script needs to run from a folder that contains "dynamic-dns.csv".  Just clone the whole repo to the same folder and it'll work
